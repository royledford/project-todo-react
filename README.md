# Project Todo App

I built this as part of a challenge to create a working app in a day (it was a long day, lol). This was meant mto demonstrate the front-end development part and does not include a back-end or database.

All the data is contained in state and will revert back to the default on a page refresh.

You can also use the refresh icon in the footer to revert back.

Built using the following:

* create-react-app
* React v16
* react-icons
* lodash

Project is deployed on github pages and can be viewed at [http://www.royledford.com/project-todo-react/](http://www.royledford.com/project-todo-react/)

## To work on the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/royledford/project-todo-react.git

yarn start
```
